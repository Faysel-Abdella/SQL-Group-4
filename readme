to make things very clear.

  2.  what does the main functionalities required?
  3.  what concepts to be included?
  4.  steps before development?

1. Overview
   an Online Auction Platform is a system that facilitates the buying and selling of goods. It allows users to place bids on items and compete with other participants to win the auction

   # How it works ?

   ✅ User Registration and Authentication:
   • Users can create an account on the platform.
   • The database stores user records, including usernames, passwords
   ✅ Item Listing:
   • Sellers can create listings for the items they wish to sell, providing details such as item description, starting price, auction duration.
   • The database stores item records, including the seller's information, item details, and the current status of the listing.
   ✅ Bidding Process:
   • Users can place bids on items they are interested in.
   • The database stores bid records, including the bidder's information, the item being bid on, the bid amount
   ✅ Auction Management:
   • The platform manages the auction process, including incrementing bids, updating the current highest bidder, and tracking the remaining time for each auction.
   • The database keeps track of the bid history for each item, along with the current highest bid and the auction end time.
   ✅ Payment and Transaction Management:
   • Once an auction ends, the platform handles the payment and transaction process between the winning bidder and the seller.
   • The database may store transaction records, including payment details, shipping information, and confirmation of the completed transaction.
